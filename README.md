# A-Smart-Car-Module-to-Detect-Lane-Violation
Most car accidents happen when people drive in the wrong lane, change lanes in dangerous ways, or pass other cars without permission. Only accidents that happen when people drive too fast happen more often.  In most automated traffic systems, finding and separating moving vehicles is very important.  Getting rid of the background and finding shadows are two of the most complex parts of separating foreground blobs in changing environments.  You need to find a good balance between speed and accuracy if you want to process a steady stream of high-resolution images from multiple cameras.  In this paper, we suggested a way to stop people from changing lanes illegally.  We gave the system some new tools to make it more useful and accurate.

The system mainly based on RGB sensor. It detects the road yellow color and make the alert that driver cross the line. Driver can see the current status in the connected device. It comes from the cloud which also store the data of the vehicle.

Fig 1: One car goes through the main road without any line violation. Another car goes through the yellow, which is wrong.
When a go through the yellow line, the system alerts the driver and also send the notification. Otherwise, the car can go fluently.  
we proposed a system that have the following features,
i.	The system makes an alert when the driver crosses the yellow line.
ii.	Send the notification to the driver’s device to see the status.
iii.Store the data in the cloud to understand the driver’s ability on road.
